# Introduction

# Project
This paper evaluates the characteristics of persons who are more likely to get Covid-19 in Toronto between 2020 and 2025 and makes some recommendations for prevention. The findings indicate that while the majority of patients recover without additional therapy, older adults are more likely to suffer serious disease than younger adults. Additionally, we discover that their major source of infection is travel, and their outbreaks are intermittent.

# Data Source

The data for this article was obtained from the website "open.toronto.ca." On the internet, select open data portal home and then search for the term "Covid" to obtain the catalogue titled "About Covid-19 Cases in Toronto." Finally, pressing the download data section gets the "COVID19 cases" dataset. In comparison to other data on covid-19 cases, this data is more informative and authoritative because it is derived directly from the provincial Case Contact Management System (CCM). This dataset includes demographic, geographic, and severity data for all confirmed and suspected cases reported to Toronto Public Health from January 2020. Additionally, sporadic and outbreak-related instances are included.

The raw data acquired from open.toronto.ca is contained in the inputs
